This implementation creates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for loan approval prediction. It analyzes the provided loan dataset by converting each applicant's data into searchable text documents, then uses semantic search to retrieve relevant profiles when users ask questions. A lightweight AI model generates human-like responses by combining the retrieved data with the user's query. The system helps users understand loan approval factors through natural language Q&A, deployed via an interactive Gradio interface for easy use. This approach balances accuracy with computational efficiency using open-source models.
